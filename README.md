## ðŸ“… Roadmap Overview

### **Phase 1 â€” AI Core & Deep Learning Mastery (Weeks 1â€“6)**
**Goal:** Be fluent in modern ML & DL, including Transformers.

**What to Learn:**
- **ML Refresh** (1â€“2 weeks)
  - Supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.
  - Algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting.
  - Tooling: scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy.
- **Deep Learning Foundations** (Weeks 2â€“6)
  - PyTorch: tensors, autograd, `torch.nn`, optimizers.
  - CNNs, RNN/LSTM, Transformers.
  - Attention, positional encoding, transfer learning.

**Deliverables by Week 6:**
- CNN, LSTM, and Transformer implemented from scratch in PyTorch.
- Kaggle competition entry (image or text classification).

---

### **Phase 2 â€” Applied AI Projects (Weeks 7â€“14)**
**Goal:** Build 2â€“3 **portfolio-ready projects**.

**Projects:**
1. **NLP Chatbot with GPT API**
   - Fine-tune on custom dataset.
   - Deploy with FastAPI + Docker on AWS/GCP.
2. **AI for Time-Series Forecasting**
   - LSTM vs Transformer on stock/crypto/housing data.
   - Live inference API.
3. *(Optional)* **Computer Vision Pipeline**
   - Object detection with YOLOv8 or custom CNN.

---

### **Phase 3 â€” MLOps & Scaling (Weeks 15â€“20)**
**Goal:** End-to-end deployment skills.

- Docker, Kubernetes basics.
- Model serving with FastAPI/TorchServe.
- CI/CD for ML (GitHub Actions, AWS Sagemaker).
- Data pipelines with Airflow/Kafka.
- SQL + NoSQL databases.

---

### **Phase 4 â€” AI Engineer Interview Prep (Weeks 21â€“24)**
**Goal:** Be job-ready for AI/ML Engineer roles.

- ML theory review: bias/variance, regularization, optimization.
- System design for ML.
- LeetCode medium/hard problems.
- Mock technical interviews.
