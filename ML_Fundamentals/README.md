ML_Fundamentals â€” Week 1: Machine Learning Fundamentals Refresh
This folder contains exercises and code for Week 1 of the ML Foundations course â€” refreshing key machine learning concepts, algorithms, and evaluation metrics.

Overview
In this week, we cover the fundamental building blocks of machine learning including:

Types of learning (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement)

Regression techniques (linear, logistic)

Tree-based methods (decision trees, random forests)

Boosting algorithms (gradient boosting with XGBoost/LightGBM)

Clustering & dimensionality reduction (k-means, PCA)

Model evaluation metrics and bias-variance tradeoff

Day-by-Day Breakdown
Day	Topic	Hands-on Task	Key Concepts & Terms

2	Linear Regression	Implement linear regression on synthetic data	Least Squares, Coefficients, Residuals
3	Logistic Regression (Binary Class)	Build spam vs. ham text classifier	Sigmoid Function, Decision Boundary, Odds & Log-odds
4	Decision Trees & Random Forests	Train & compare on Titanic dataset	Tree Nodes, Leaves, Overfitting, Ensemble Methods
5	Gradient Boosting (XGBoost / LightGBM)	Build gradient boosting classification model	Weak Learners, Residuals, Learning Rate
6	Clustering (k-means) & PCA	Cluster MNIST digits & visualize PCA	Centroids, Variance, Principal Components, Eigenvectors
7	Model Evaluation & Biasâ€“Variance	Compare metrics on one dataset in a notebook/script	Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC, Bias, Variance

How to Use This Folder
Each dayâ€™s folder/script contains code and exercises for that dayâ€™s topic.

You can find supplementary YouTube videos linked in the .md files or inside this README for deeper explanations.

Run code scripts or notebooks to explore and understand ML concepts hands-on.

Use the provided tasks to reinforce theory through practice.

Additional Notes
This week focuses on refreshing core ML concepts before moving on to deep learning.

Make sure to review all metrics and understand their tradeoffs, especially bias vs. variance.

Experiment with hyperparameters in tree-based and boosting methods to see effects on accuracy and overfitting.

Happy Learning! ðŸš€
